Actual Error = (0.860-0.857)/0.860 = 3%

(This is much smaller than the error we obtained in Test 1, which was about 10%)

(The current transfer accuracy is much better.)

Voltage drop across Rm is neglected.

Vc/V    Io/mA
-15     0.857
-12.5   0.857
-10     0.857
-7.5    0.856
-5      0.856

Output resistance = Delta_Vout / Delta_Iout = 2.5V / 0.001mA(0.000mA) = 2.5M ohm --> tends to infinity --> Really large

Therefore, no matter how Vout changes, Iout stays constant, resulting in a ideal current mirror.
