Notes for Test 5

Why is the DC value of v_0 at roughly -4V ? -- Don't know		!!!

Amplifier gain measurement at v_d 15mv (peak-peak) at 1kHz.

Peak to Peak of Input Signal: 	15mV
Peak to Peak of Output Signal: 	(-3.85)-(-4.14)= 0.29V = 290mV

Gain Vout/Vin = 19.33 

ToDo: Differential Input resistance section				!!!
