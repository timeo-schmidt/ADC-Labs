1: How to calculate Rb

(5-(-4.3))/Rb = 1m / 200
estimated value Rb = 1860000 ohm

Rc = 5/1m = 5k ohm


After acutally measuring, Rb needs to be 1944143 ohm to produce an Ic of 1mA.

This implies that Beta of the transistor 2N2222 is actually 

1m / ((5-(-4.346))/1944143) = Beta
Beta = 208

2: Deriving equation (6)

vo = -gmVbe*(r0//Rc)
vin = vbe

Av = vo/vin = -gm*(r0//Rc)

3:  Measure the output voltage of the amplifier when its input is open-circuit and adjust RB to get Vo less than ±0.2V.

Measured, it's shown in picture test4_prep.

4: Prediction from equation(6) 

r0 = Ea/Ic = 100V / 1mA = 100k ohm

Av = -gm [Rc//r0] = - (1m / 25m) * [5000//100k] = 190.48

 
Actual Av = -(2.625 + 4.900)/2 / 20m = 188.125 
(It is very close to the prediction.)


Input resistance:

	1: vout = (2.625+4.900)/2 = 7.525/2 = 3.7625V (amplitude)

	2.v'out = (1.23+1.32)/2 = 1.275V (amplitude) it has decreased

	because vout = v'out (1+10k/ Rin)

	3.7625 = 1.275*(1+10000/Rin)

	Rin = 5125.63 ohm

Active Loads
The voltage gain of the original high gain amplifier can be increased to a maximum by making RC >> r0 so that
AV = -gm r0 (from equation 7). However, this would be impractical because:
 It would require a much larger power supply to maintain the same collector current.
 A 1MΩ resistor could probably consume more chip area than the rest of the transistors in the op-amp (to give you some idea of resistor size in an integrated circuit).
 Stray capacitance associated with large resistors can be destructive for high frequency performance.

By having an active load, we can have a very large collector resistor with almost the same chip area as a single transistor.


Test 4:

1.Build up th circuit.

2. (5-0.7-(-5))/Rb = 1mA
Rb = 9.3k ohm

3. 0.7/R1 = 2IB = 1mA/208*2
       R1 = 72.8k ohm

	4.3/2R2 = 3IB
	R2 = 149kohm

4. input amplitude: 3.0mV
output amplitude: 4.65V

Av = 4.65/3.0m = 1.55k
